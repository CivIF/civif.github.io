# Joining the Imperial Federation as a new state

Oftentime a state is created out of an federal land or federal district for a group of people who are interested in living and building their own place. But a existing nation can join the Imperial Federation as a state. A potential state has to go through admission process in the Senate where a admission of a new state requires majority vote to pass before become a new state in the Imperial Federation.

Once a new state joined the Imperial Federation as a state, they are expected to compile or integrate their laws and constitution with the Federal constitution to ensure there is no conflicting authority between the Federal government, the Monarch, and the state government. Note that the form of government doesn't matter, as long as a state show their way to choose their leader and senator.

To have your nation or settlement join the Imperial Federation, there are two ways;

- State
- Territory

To be considered as a state, you must have:

- A active population of 3 or more
- Clear way to choose a leader and senator
- Established town or a planned town with a given coordinate

To be considered as a territory, you must have:

- Less than population of 2 or less
- A planned town with a given coordinate
- Clear way to choose a leader to represent

The difference between a territory and a state is a territory does have federal oversight ensuring a territory is used and being developed. They're often run by a small group of friend or solo which is highly recommended for those who prefer not to run a state or does not want too many people. While a state get autonomy, form its own government, can host more than one town (most states usually have only one town or two), and create and enforce their own laws. However territories and states are subject to the federal constitution and federal laws and should be followed all time.

Regardless of the status of a land (state or territory), individuals who are part of a state or territory receive citizenship of the Imperial Federation automatically upon admission.
