## PREFACE

> The Imperial Federation shall strive to bring peace and prosperity to the world while still allowing citizens to retain autonomy in their States. Protection from external threats, along with organizing large scale efforts of defense, infrastructure, and factories to give us common goals to work towards.

> We, the citizens of the Imperial Federation, in pursuit of justice, liberty, and prosperity, establish this Constitution to guide our Federation with wisdom and strength. Committed to sovereignty, order, and cooperation, we uphold the freedoms of our people, the autonomy of our States, and the unity of our Federation under the Sovereign.

> The Imperial Federation shall be a sovereign, semi-democratic, federal constitutional monarchy—a union of self-governing States and territories bound together by the Imperial Government and the Sovereign in a shared commitment to order, liberty, and prosperity. Each State serves as a pillar of the Federation, entrusted with self-rule while upholding the principles of justice, security, and cooperation with both one another and the Imperial Government. As a constitutional federation, the Imperial Federation is upheld by the Sovereign, who provides stability and legitimacy; the Imperial Government, which ensures effective administration; the States, which exercise autonomy within the framework of unity; the Senate, which represents the States and holds ultimate legislative authority; and the Judiciary, which safeguards legal and constitutional compliance.
